**Automation of Continous Integration** (**ON Pull_request**)
* Automate the build
* Introduce automated test
    -Unit test
    -Integration test
* Linting (to unified code style)
* Security/Scanning Checks (Optional but better include as early as possible)
* Deploy to staging for extra security.
* After merging run the workflow again.

2) What problems does CI solve ?
3) How does cPython do CI ?
