## Where do I see myself in the next 5 years?

So far, I have always followed a well-defined career plan. Of course, there have been ups and downs, and occasional setbacks, but over time, I've consistently managed to achieve what I set out to do. Technically, my focus has primarily been on front-end development, utilizing tools like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to build responsive, scalable applications. Along the way, I've also gained experience with backend concepts and tools.

In the next 5 years, my goal is to transition into a **Full Stack Software Engineer** role, where I can deepen my backend skills and contribute to building even more robust and performant applications. I am also passionate about helping others grow. As a **Google Developer Group (GDG) co-organizer**, I have mentored junior developers and shared resources to help them enter the tech industry. In the future, I want to **step into a senior role** where I can **mentor within the company**, guiding newer team members and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

Additionally, **public speaking** and sharing knowledge with the broader tech community is something I plan to expand on. I want to encourage and inspire others through **technical talks**, workshops, and other forms of knowledge sharing. I also aim to **bring new ideas** to the company, using my experience and foresight to help solve real-world problems and drive innovation.

Ultimately, I see myself becoming a **technical leader**, combining my passion for technology with a strong focus on mentoring, collaboration, and bringing fresh perspectives to the table to help the company thrive.
